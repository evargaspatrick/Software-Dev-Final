# Software-Dev-Final

This program serves as my project submission for Software Development 1.

The C++GameLibrary program is very simple to use, it allows users to 
manage their digital game library. Users can add, remove, edit, delete their library, and view games in 
their library using a menu-driven interface. The application stores game data 
in a text file named C++GameLib.txt.

It's intended to be used essentially as a ledger for games users have collected over time,
and it helps to show how some games have changed in size since their inception.
Anyway, enjoy!


How to use:
Download and run the C++GameLibrary.exe
You must input integers to use the corresponding/following options.
1. View Game Libary
2. Add a game
3. Remove a game
4. Edit a game entry
5. Exit the library
6. Delete your library

From there the program is super straightforward with you either having to 
fill out information about the game you are editing or adding, or having to
insert a single int to continue within the program.

Note: To reiterate, the program does have a loading and save function. So you don't have to worry
about losing your ledger of games. The .txt for the ledger is called 'C++GameLib'
and can be found in the current AD the user ran the program.
